1. Raw Data: 
## 1. File Description
This Excel workbook contains numeric responses from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) answering a 14-question behavioral economics questionnaire.
Each worksheet corresponds to a specific model and temperature condition.
Each row represents one trial, and each column (Q1–Q14) represents one numeric answer produced by the model.
## 2. Worksheets Included
The workbook contains the following sheets:
DeepSeek Reasoner (Temperatures 0 to 2)
deepseek_0_temp
deepseek_0_5_temp
deepseek_1_temp
deepseek_1_5_temp
deepseek_2_temp
Gemini (Temperatures 0 to 2)
gemini_0_temp
gemini_0_5_temp
gemini_1_temp
gemini_1_5_temp
gemini_2_temp
GPT-4.0 (Temperatures 0 to 2)
gpt4_0_temp
gpt4_0_5_temp
gpt4_1_temp
gpt4_1_5_temp
gpt4_2_temp
GPT-4o (Temperatures 0 to 2)
gpt4o_0_temp
gpt4o_0_5_temp
gpt4o_1_temp
gpt4o_1_5_temp
gpt4o_2_temp
Names may vary slightly depending on your export, but each follows the same pattern.
3. Sheet Structure
Every worksheet uses the same format:
Column A: Trial (trial number)
Columns B–O: Q1–Q14, the numeric answers provided by the LLM for each question
All values in Q1–Q14 are numeric and have been extracted from the original text outputs.
4. Notes
Each model–temperature combination has its own sheet.
Trials within each sheet are independent runs of the same questionnaire.



All model outputs were generated between October 5 and October 9, 2025. Dates are reported in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
•	GPT-5: 2025-10-05
•	Gemini (all temperatures): 2025-10-05
•	DeepSeek Reasoner (all temperatures): 2025-10-08
•	GPT-4.0 (all temperatures): 2025-10-09
